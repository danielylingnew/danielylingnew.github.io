I"u<p><em>Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I’ve learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>I think creativity is such an interesting category of productivity. We can be creative in a wide variety of disciplines - music composition, writing, scientific research, company-building, anything. And I think tenets of creativity in one discipline can help inform work in another area. This “cross-pollination” can be useful I think.</p>

<p>I’ll be putting my writing on Substack in addition to my personal website, so that people can sign up and get it sent directly to their inboxes. Hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />
Daniel</p>
